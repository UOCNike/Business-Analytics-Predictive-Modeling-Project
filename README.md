# Business Analytics & Predictive Modeling Project  

This project showcases a full end-to-end analytics workflow using **HR** and **Marketing Campaign** datasets to extract insights and build predictive models for business decision-making.  

## Project Overview  
The goal of this project was to explore, clean, and analyze real business datasets, then build regression and classification models to predict employee attrition and campaign response rates. The project concludes with actionable recommendations that can be applied to workforce retention and marketing optimization.  

## Key Steps  
- **Data Preparation & EDA**  
  - Cleaned and transformed HR and marketing data.  
  - Handled missing values, removed duplicates, treated outliers, and corrected skewness.  
  - Visualized data with histograms, boxplots, and correlation heatmaps.  

- **Feature Engineering**  
  - Derived new features and selected significant predictors based on correlation and business relevance.  

- **Model Building**  
  - **Multiple Linear Regression:** Estimated key business metrics from HR and marketing features.  
  - **Logistic Regression:** Predicted employee attrition likelihood and campaign response.  

- **Model Evaluation**  
  - Used **RÂ²** and **RMSE** for regression evaluation.  
  - Applied **confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC** for classification models.  

- **Insights & Recommendations**  
  - Identified key factors driving attrition and campaign performance.  
  - Suggested actionable steps to improve retention and optimize marketing ROI.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Languages & Libraries:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Statsmodels, Scikit-learn  
- **Techniques:** EDA, Feature Engineering, Regression Modeling, Classification, Model Evaluation  
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook
