# Business Analytics & Predictive Modeling Project  

This project showcases a full end-to-end analytics workflow using **HR** and **Marketing Campaign** datasets to extract insights and build predictive models for business decision-making.  

## Project Overview  
The goal of this project was to explore, clean, and analyze real business datasets, then build regression and classification models to predict employee attrition and campaign response rates. The project concludes with actionable recommendations that can be applied to workforce retention and marketing optimization.  

## Project Script 1 – HR Analytics  
- **Dataset:** HR dataset containing employee demographics, job satisfaction, salary, working hours, and performance indicators.  
- **Steps Performed:**  
  - Data cleaning, missing value treatment, and outlier detection.  
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with descriptive statistics, boxplots, and histograms.  
  - Bivariate analysis using correlation matrices and visualizations.  
  - Identified key drivers of employee attrition and generated actionable insights.  

## Project Script 2 – Marketing Campaign Analysis  
- **Dataset:** Marketing campaign dataset with customer demographics, purchase behavior, and campaign response.  
- **Steps Performed:**  
  - Data preparation, handling of missing values, outlier treatment, and feature engineering.  
  - Created `TotalMnt` variable for total customer spend and performed descriptive analysis.  
  - Built **Multiple Linear Regression** model to predict spending (`TotalMnt`) and checked assumptions (linearity, homoscedasticity, residual normality).  
  - Built **Logistic Regression** model to predict campaign response.  
  - Evaluated models using R², RMSE, confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC curve.  
  - Derived business insights and recommendations for campaign optimization.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Languages & Libraries:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Statsmodels, Scikit-learn  
- **Techniques:** EDA, Feature Engineering, Regression Modeling, Classification, Model Evaluation  
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook
